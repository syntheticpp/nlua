nlua  0.1
---------

nlua is a binding between C++ and Lua.
(nlua short for 'namespace lua')

The main idea is to have a C++ API which follows
the 'table' approach. The written C++ code should
a little bit look like Lua code.

Another goal is to have easy to understand and
maintain code base. Using templates couldn't be
avoided but not much meta-programming is used.

In the test directory are examples how the example
binding of the book "Programming in Lua" could be
transformed into nlua code.

Documentation is not needed because the code
reads like prose. ;)
