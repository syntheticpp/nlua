nlua -- namespace lua

nlua is a binding between C++ and Lua.

The main idea is to have a C++ API which follows
the 'table' approach: the C++ code should look
a little bit like Lua code.

Another goal is to have an easy to understand and
maintain code base. Using templates couldn't be
avoided but not much meta-programming is used.

In the test directory are examples how the example
binding of the book "Programming in Lua" could be
transformed into nlua code.
